# Student Portfolio Template

A **complete GitHub repository** for creating a professional student resume/portfolio website. Designed for learning **Git basics**, **GitHub-Jira integration**, and **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using This Template

1. **Create your repository:**
   - Click **"Use this template"** button above
   - Name your repository: `<your-username>.github.io` (this enables GitHub Pages)
   - Make sure it's public (required for free GitHub Pages)

2. **Clone locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-username>.github.io.git
   cd <your-username>.github.io
   ```

3. **Start customizing:**
   - Replace placeholder content with your information
   - Add your photos to `assets/images/`
   - Update links and contact information

4. **Deploy:**
   - Push changes to main branch
   - Your site will be live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io`

## üìö Learning Git Basics

This template is designed for hands-on Git practice. Complete these exercises in order:

### 1. Basic Git Commands

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# See what changed
git diff
```

**Practice Exercise:** Make a small change to `index.html`, then:
```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Update homepage title"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Branching Workflow

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/about-page

# Make changes to about.html
# Add and commit your changes
git add about.html
git commit -m "Add personal information to about page"

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Merge your feature branch
git merge feature/about-page

# Push changes
git push origin main
```

**Practice Exercises:**
- Create a `feature/projects` branch and add a new project
- Create a `feature/contact` branch and update contact information
- Practice merging and resolving any conflicts

### 3. Advanced Git Operations

```bash
# Undo the last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo changes to a file
git checkout -- filename.html

# View detailed history
git log --graph --oneline --all

# Rebase for clean history
git checkout feature/new-feature
git rebase main
```

**Practice Exercises:**
- Intentionally create a merge conflict and resolve it
- Practice rebasing a feature branch onto main
- Use `git revert` to undo a commit safely

### 4. Remote Operations

```bash
# Add a remote repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo.git

# Fetch updates from remote
git fetch origin

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Push to different branch
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

## üîó GitHub Integration

### Pull Requests Workflow

1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/experience-page
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add experience.html
   git commit -m "Add internship experience"
   git push origin feature/experience-page
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request:**
   - Go to GitHub repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your feature branch
   - Write descriptive title and description
   - Request review (if working in a team)

4. **Merge and cleanup:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -d feature/experience-page
   ```

### Working with Issues

- Create issues for new features or bugs
- Reference issues in commits: `git commit -m "Fix navigation bug (#5)"`
- Close issues via commits: `git commit -m "Add contact form, closes #3"`

## üéØ Jira Integration

### Smart Commits

Connect your commits to Jira tickets using Smart Commit syntax:

```bash
# Update Jira issue with comment
git commit -m "PROJ-101 #comment Added About Me section with personal background"

# Transition issue to "In Progress"
git commit -m "PROJ-102 #in-progress Working on projects showcase page"

# Mark issue as done
git commit -m "PROJ-103 #done Completed responsive navigation menu"

# Log time worked
git commit -m "PROJ-104 #time 2h #comment Implemented contact form validation"

# Combine multiple actions
git commit -m "PROJ-105 #done #time 3h #comment Portfolio homepage complete with hero section"
```

### Jira Integration Setup

1. **Connect repositories:**
   - In Jira, go to Settings ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí DVCS accounts
   - Add your GitHub repository
   - Configure Smart Commit settings

2. **Project workflow:**
   - Create Jira epic: "Portfolio Website Development"
   - Break into stories: "Homepage", "About Page", "Projects", etc.
   - Use Smart Commits to update progress automatically

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Setting up the Deployment Pipeline

The repository includes a template GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. 

**Learning approach - build the pipeline step by step:**

1. **Start simple:** Uncomment the basic workflow structure
2. **Add checkout:** Uncomment the checkout step  
3. **Add deployment:** Uncomment the Pages deployment steps
4. **Test and debug:** Push changes and watch the Actions tab

### Complete Workflow Example

Once you understand each step, here's the full `deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build & Deploy Portfolio

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
        
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./
          
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Advanced Pipeline Features

As you learn more, enhance your pipeline:

```yaml
# Add HTML validation
- name: Validate HTML
  run: |
    npm install -g html-validate
    html-validate *.html

# Add accessibility testing
- name: Accessibility Check
  uses: pa11y/pa11y-action@v3
  with:
    url: https://${{ github.actor }}.github.io

# Add performance testing
- name: Lighthouse CI
  uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v9
  with:
    uploadArtifacts: true
```
